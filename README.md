# Hi, I'm João Zardo 👋
🎓 Chem. Engineer | 💼 Innovation & R&D | 💻 CS Student | Bridging Engineering, Data & Strategy

I am driven by two things: a deep curiosity to understand **how things work** at a fundamental level, and a pragmatic need to use that knowledge as a **lever for human time and cognition.**

This philosophy has guided my entire career, from engineering to innovation management, and it's the reason I am now studying Computer Science.

### 💡 My Journey in Three Acts

#### 1. The Engineering Lab (Undergraduate - Chem. Eng.)
My curiosity drove my academics. I didn't just want to use formulas; I needed to see them work. I taught myself **Delphi** to build applications that automated complex engineering calculations, not just to save time, but to fundamentally understand the processes I was studying.

#### 2. The Proving Ground (MSc, Project & Innovation Management)
With a **Master's in Chemical Engineering (UFSC)**, I applied this mindset to business. I specialized in managing complex R&D projects, acting as the "translator" between deep technical innovation and strategic value. Because I understand *how* the tech works, I could effectively lead projects **funded by** major agencies (like FAPESC and Finep) and **recognized by** the industry (Prêmio Inovação Catarinense, ABIQUIM).

#### 3. The New Toolkit (Computer Science)
Today, I am expanding my technical stack. I am not satisfied just *using* modern software; I need to understand *how it's built, secured, and validated*. I am currently studying Computer Science to strengthen my core competencies with **Python, SQL, Data Analysis, and Information Security**.

### 🧠 My Core Philosophy

My approach is defined by two complementary principles: the Engineer's "Why" and the Manager's "How."

**1. The "Why" (First-Principles Curiosity):**
I am driven by a deep, fundamental need to understand *how things work*. I'm not satisfied with black boxes. This "first-principles" mindset, carried over from engineering, allows me to analyze systems accurately, identify the true root of a problem, and build robust, lasting solutions.

**2. The "How" (Pragmatic Time-to-Value):**
My curiosity is always balanced and filtered by a single, pragmatic question:
> "Is the time invested in developing this solution *less* than the time it will save?"

I focus on the **Time-to-Value ratio**. This ensures I'm not just *building things right*, but that I'm building the *right things*.

### 🎯 Current Focus

My immediate, concrete goal is to **integrate this modern IT toolkit (Python, SQL, Security) deep into my problem-solving arsenal.**

My aim is to be a professional who can bridge the gap between complex processes (from engineering or business) and the technical solutions that optimize them. I am building the skills to not only *manage* innovation but to be able to *technically analyze* and *validate* it at the data level.
